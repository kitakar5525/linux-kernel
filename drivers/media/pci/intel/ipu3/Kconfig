	  This is the Intel IPU3 CIO2 CSI-2 receiver unit, found in Intel
	  Skylake and Kaby Lake SoCs and used for capturing images and
	  video from a camera sensor.

	  Say Y or M here if you have a Skylake/Kaby Lake SoC with MIPI CSI-2
	  connected camera.
	  The module will be called ipu3-cio2.

	help
	  This extension provides an API for the ipu3-cio2 driver to create
	  connections to cameras that are hidden in SSDB buffer in ACPI. It
	  can be used to enable support for cameras in detachable / hybrid
	  devices that ship with Windows.

	  Say Y here if your device is a detachable / hybrid laptop that comes
	  with Windows installed by the OEM, for example:

	  	- Microsoft Surface models (except Surface Pro 3)
		- The Lenovo Miix line (for example the 510, 520, 710 and 720)
		- Dell 7285

	  If in doubt, say N here.
